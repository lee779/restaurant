##Restaurant Project Repository
Restaurant Project consists of 5 agents (the host, waiter, customer, cook, and cashier). This simulates a restaurant with normative and non normative scenarios listed below. See file name "doc" for agent design documentation.

Normal scenario

1. User can add new customers with cash values. Based on the cash value, customer will make a decision on which item it can buy from the menu. If he is too poor to afford anything, he will leave.
2. Waiters can be added and can request for breaks. The host determines if the waiter can go on the break. (ie. Host will not grant a waiter a break if he is the only waiter working)
3. Customer picks food, eats, and pays at the cashier.

Non-normal scenario
1. Customer can be a thief and order food that he cannot pay.
2. Cashier will give the customer(thief) a warning.
3. If that same customer returns, he is sent to the cook to do dishes if he refuses to pay again.
